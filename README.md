# Google-Data-Analytics-Cyclistic-Bike-Share
This project is a showcase of my process from start to finish in relation to the Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Case Stuy, the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis. This project is meant to practice and develop skills in various Data Analytic tools. As such, repetitive tasks may be observed in an effort to distinguish and experience how certain programs handle certain tasks differently.*

Please access the PDF file titled "Google Data Analytics - Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Presentation" to see a presentation of my findings and analysis.
